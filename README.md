Website for cash offer website
Website I built with Bootstrap, Jquery, and Html

Description
Website that is designed for a company to use to help users input their information into the website so that the company can hopefully buy their properties from them.

Cool Features
Boostrap, SCSS, and Jquery

Things I learned
Learned on how to implement Bootstrap and Jquery into a project. Also, learned a lot about design and placement. If I had more time for the project; I think I would of made it more streamlined. A problem that I discovered was trying to make the website too busy. Simple is better
